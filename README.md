## Description
"The potential of every child is unlimited," said Dr. Shinichi Suzuki, founder of the Suzuki music pedagogy. Their potential is, indeed, unlimited but not their attention span! Enter ***Unlimited***, the app that will help you keep young musicians engaged and consistent in their practices.

A full-stack CRUD application built with C#, ASP .NET Core MVC, SQL database, HTTP-based APIs, a single-page React application with Firebase authentication and deployed with Azure and Firebase, ***Unlimited*** is a one-stop shop where "practice partners" can create custom practice plans, browse games from the database, filter them based on their child's age and instrument, and track progress.
